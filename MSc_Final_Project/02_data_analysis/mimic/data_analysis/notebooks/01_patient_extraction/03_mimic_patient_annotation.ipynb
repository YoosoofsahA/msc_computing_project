The goal of placing a patient on ventilation is for them to be eventually extubated and if they require further ventilation or die, ventilatory support and consequent extubation cannot be deemed to be successful.\n","\n","If neither is applicable but they are required to be placed on ventilatory support such as CPAP and BIPAP, which are all forms of Non-invasive ventilation. As per Dr Murali, were this to be required within 6 hours of extubation - it is indicative that these patients have not recovered fully and this group would likley struggle with further intervention. As such, this is deemed to be classed as failure.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"aoSfhytxMcpU"},"source":["We will apply each criterion one at a time with the intention of fully annotating the derived patient set for model training."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"jk2WJ5DpNTOU","outputId":"dbb72c6c-373d-4650-ba72-95db2dd030db"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"OktNbJ_4NaHt"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"XCGgXY5cZ1up","outputId":"24b61be8-8d39-45e6-b3a6-4713d579d599"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["5970"]},"execution_count":15,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Load patient set\n","patients_file_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/MSc_Final_Project/02_data_analysis/mimic/mimic_data_analysis/datasets/exclusion_criteria/criteria_6.parquet'\n","patients_df = pd.read_parquet(patients_file_path)\n","patients_df.shape[0]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"AtnVQfZXMoBV"},"source":["**Re-intubation within 48 hours of extubation**\n","\n","Re-intubation (invasive ventilation) can be determined by looking at the procedure_events table.\n","\n","Intubation events have the itemid: 244385.
