There can be significant variability among individuals based on factors like lung capacity, respiratory health, activity level, and body size.\n","\n","- Minute Volume (MV): This is the total volume of air breathed in one minute, which is a product of tidal volume and respiratory rate.

calibration issues, leading to incorrect readings.\n","- Data Entry Errors: Manual data entry errors can lead to incorrect values being recorded.\n","\n","Clinical Interventions:\n","\n","- Ventilator Settings: Patients on mechanical ventilation can have widely varying tidal and minute volumes based on their clinical condition and the ventilator settings applied by healthcare providers.\n","- Therapeutic Changes: Changes in therapy, such as adjusting ventilator settings or administering certain medications, can cause abrupt changes in tidal and minute volumes.\n","\n","Acute Conditions:\n","\n","- Respiratory Diseases: Patients with conditions like ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), or other acute respiratory conditions can exhibit abnormal tidal and minute volumes.\n","- Acute Events: Sudden changes in a patient's condition, such as during a respiratory crisis, can lead to temporary but significant
