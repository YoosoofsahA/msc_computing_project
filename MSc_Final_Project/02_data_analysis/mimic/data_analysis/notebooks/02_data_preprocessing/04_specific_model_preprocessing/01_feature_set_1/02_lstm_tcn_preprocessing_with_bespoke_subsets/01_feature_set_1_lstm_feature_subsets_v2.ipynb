This led to some difficulties in implementing the Fused LSTM model as each LSTM layer was being trained on different set of patients and the loss could not be calculated accurately as we could not pass the global list of labels since each layer had its own respective labels depending on the patients in the subset.\n","\n","To rectify this, we will ensure all patients are in all subsets and where there is no data at all, this will be filled with NaNs and later masked so the model does not learn from that data. This helps preserve the original data and avoids bias from imputation.\n","\n","We still want to minimise any data synthesis."],"metadata":{"id":"pKx5F78fyzzd"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"DJnSMjh_yw4c","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1722245162624,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":735,"user":{"displayName":"Akram Yoosoofsah","userId":"15428459772312358460"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import os\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"xBzP6W430TJG","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1722245289805,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":22551,"user":{"displayName":"Akram Yoosoofsah","userId":"15428459772312358460"}},"outputId":"f7a9ee08-c7e3-43a0-d8c5-fd972336d603"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Step 1: Load the time series data**"],"metadata":{"id":"5qFetJvu0mem"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Load the train and test data\n","train_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/MSc_Final_Project/02_data_analysis/mimic/data_analysis/datasets/07_data_preprocessing/01_feature_set_1/01_preprocessing_v2/03_train_data_standard_preprocess_done.parquet'\n","test_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/MSc_Final_Project/02_data_analysis/mimic/data_analysis/datasets/07_data_preprocessing/01_feature_set_1/01_preprocessing_v2/03_test_data_standard_preprocess_done.parquet'\n","\n","train_df = pd.read_parquet(train_path)\n","test_df = pd.read_parquet(test_path)\n","\n","train_df.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":313},"id":"ga5tURrD0pS4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1722245409801,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":4123,"user":{"displayName":"Akram Yoosoofsah","userId":"15428459772312358460"}},"outputId":"5fcb4142-d696-44db-ce82-f1ae2faabd40"},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   subject_id  itemid  valuenum  time_to_extubation_mins  \\\n","0    10001884  223835      40.0                    160.0   \n","1    10001884  224685       NaN                    160.0   \n","2    10001884  224686       NaN                    160.0   \n","3    10001884  224687       6.1                    160.0   \n","4    10001884  224695      17.0                    160.0   \n","\n","   time_from_window_start                       label  extubation_failure  \n","0                   200.0        Inspired O2 Fraction                   1  \n","1                   200.0     Tidal Volume (observed)                   1  \n","2                   200.0  Tidal Volume (spontaneous)                   1  \n","3                   200.0               Minute Volume                   1  \n","4                   200.0         Peak Insp.
