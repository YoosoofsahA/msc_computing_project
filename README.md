# MSc Computing Final Project

This is the repo for my MSc Computing Final project looking at the use of machine learning to predict whether a patient can be successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation.

Note, all raw data extracted from MIMIC-IV has been removed as it requires credentialed access. This can be obtained from: https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/3.0/
